Part of a limited-edition capsule collection released in May 2019, this rendition sports an earth-toned color palette of Shimmer, Mahogany Mink, Velvet Brown and Tough Red hues on a premium leather and suede upper. Unique perforation patterns and an offset Jumpman logo accent the underlay, while signature Patta script dresses the triple-tone midsole. A durable rubber outsole equipped with Air technology reinforces the design, which is inspired by Michael Jordan&#39;s run with the Dream Team at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona.",
